# Sports Person Classifier
 Flask is a lightweight web framework that enables developers to create web applications quickly and easily. It is written in Python and is known for its simplicity and flexibility. Flask is ideal for creating web applications that require a small number of features, making it perfect for deploying machine learning models.
The sports person classifier is a web-based application that uses Flask, an open-source framework, to deploy a machine learning model capable of identifying five famous sports personalities.

To use the application, a user will upload an image of a sportsperson. The image will be sent to the Flask server, which will process it using the pre-trained model. The model will generate a prediction based on the input image, and Flask will display the result on the user's web browser.

The user interface of the application will be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to upload an image and get a quick result. The application will also display the probability score for each of the five sports personalities, indicating how confident the model is in its prediction.

Overall, the sports person classifier is an excellent example of how Flask can be used to deploy machine learning models quickly and easily. With its simple and flexible architecture, Flask makes it easy to create web applications that can be used to perform complex tasks such as image classification.
